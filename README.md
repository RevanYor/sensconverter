## How It Works

The converter uses the cm/360Â° method to ensure accurate sensitivity conversion between games. This means it calculates how many centimeters of mouse movement are required to perform a 360-degree turn in-game, then converts this value between different game sensitivity scales.

## Technical Details

- **Frontend**: Vanilla JavaScript with Tailwind CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express for serving static files
- **No database required**: All conversion factors are stored in the frontend code
